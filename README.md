## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Primarily played around with flexbox and the `<div>` element as container. The most "difficult" part was how to center stuff which seems to be an issue until you learn more about flexbox.

### Continued development

Definitely learn more about how to use flexbox in order to construct larger building blocks of HTML.

### Useful resources

- [Center two divs horizontally and vertically (CSS)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34134986/10871402) - Found how to center vertically and horizontally 2 `<div>` elements.
